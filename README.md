# datepicker

This is an Airflight Ticket Reservation I had created for my senior applied development project. Programming languages
used to created this project include (HTML/CSS,JAVASCRIPT,PHP,JQUERY). The objective was to create a reservation system website for users 
who want to book flight. The backend is where information is created and stored with PHP and SQL.
